          <br><br/> Key Accounts:  <br><br/>
          These are on-trade Modern outlets. The accounts enables’ the company to move products in volumes. These accounts are key strategic partners to the business. They are customers that require special terms & touch hence the need to have direct contact persons for proper and clear communication. Basically the accounts contribute up-to 60% of the company’s universal customer base. 
          
          
          <br><br/>Delivery by order  <br><br/>
          This is a channel of distribution with a customer base of over 900 clients. It’s used to demarcate the target region into different market segments by assigning distribution sales reps. Additionally, the channel gives the company raw and real time data on the market dynamics. We would gladly say that it’s the largest volume mover for the company and it reaches out to greater masses. It helps in ensuring business sustainability through daily cash flow. Practictically we’d say these involves door to door delivery to customers which in return builds broader brand awareness and visibility while creating traction for the products. It also gives an opportunity to make the company’s Sales representatives to act as brand ambassadors for all products which helps to edifice and passing brand knowledge to the masses, just but to say we achieve unmatched brand building through route to market.
